  abstract  = {Quantum mechanics was still in its infancy in 1932 when the
               young John von Neumann, who would go on to become one of the
               greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, published
               Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics---a revolutionary
               book that for the first time provided a rigorous mathematical
               framework for the new science. Robert Beyer's 1955 English
               translation, which von Neumann reviewed and approved, is cited
               more frequently today than ever before. But its many treasures
               and insights were too often obscured by the limitations of the
               way the text and equations were set on the page. This new
               edition of this classic work has been completely reset in TeX,
               making the text and equations far easier to read. The book has
               also seen the correction of a handful of typographic errors,
               revision of some sentences for clarity and readability,
               provision of an index for the first time, and prefatory remarks
               drawn from the writings of L{\'e}on Van Hove and Freeman Dyson
               have been added. The result brings new life to an essential work
               in theoretical physics and mathematics.},

  abstract      = {Quantum circuits -- built from local unitary gates and local measurements --
                   are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to
                   explore universal collective phenomena far-from-equilibrium. These models have
                   shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the
                   underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In
                   addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena
                   with no traditional analog, such as new dynamical phases in quantum systems
                   that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also
                   topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators
                   that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit
                   elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being
                   mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice
                   models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be
                   identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more
                   structured many-body dynamics.}
