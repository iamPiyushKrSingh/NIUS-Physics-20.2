  abstract  = {Quantum mechanics was still in its infancy in 1932 when the
               young John von Neumann, who would go on to become one of the
               greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, published
               Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics---a revolutionary
               book that for the first time provided a rigorous mathematical
               framework for the new science. Robert Beyer's 1955 English
               translation, which von Neumann reviewed and approved, is cited
               more frequently today than ever before. But its many treasures
               and insights were too often obscured by the limitations of the
               way the text and equations were set on the page. This new
               edition of this classic work has been completely reset in TeX,
               making the text and equations far easier to read. The book has
               also seen the correction of a handful of typographic errors,
               revision of some sentences for clarity and readability,
               provision of an index for the first time, and prefatory remarks
               drawn from the writings of L{\'e}on Van Hove and Freeman Dyson
               have been added. The result brings new life to an essential work
               in theoretical physics and mathematics.},
