  abstract  = {Quantum mechanics was still in its infancy in 1932 when the
               young John von Neumann, who would go on to become one of the
               greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, published
               Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics---a revolutionary
               book that for the first time provided a rigorous mathematical
               framework for the new science. Robert Beyer's 1955 English
               translation, which von Neumann reviewed and approved, is cited
               more frequently today than ever before. But its many treasures
               and insights were too often obscured by the limitations of the
               way the text and equations were set on the page. This new
               edition of this classic work has been completely reset in TeX,
               making the text and equations far easier to read. The book has
               also seen the correction of a handful of typographic errors,
               revision of some sentences for clarity and readability,
               provision of an index for the first time, and prefatory remarks
               drawn from the writings of L{\'e}on Van Hove and Freeman Dyson
               have been added. The result brings new life to an essential work
               in theoretical physics and mathematics.},

                   are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to
                   explore universal collective phenomena far-from-equilibrium. These models have
                   shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the
                   underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In
                   addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena
                   with no traditional analog, such as new dynamical phases in quantum systems
                   that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also
                   topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators
                   that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit
                   elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being
                   mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice
                   models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be
                   identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more
                   structured many-body dynamics.}

  abstract      = {We define quantum cellular automata as infinite quantum lattice systems with
                   discrete time dynamics, such that the time step commutes with lattice
                   translations and has strictly finite propagation speed. In contrast to earlier
                   definitions this allows us to give an explicit characterization of all local
                   rules generating such automata. The same local rules also generate the global
                   time step for automata with periodic boundary conditions. Our main structure
                   theorem asserts that any quantum cellular automaton is structurally reversible,
                   i.e., that it can be obtained by applying two blockwise unitary operations in a
                   generalized Margolus partitioning scheme. This implies that, in contrast to the
                   classical case, the inverse of a nearest neighbor quantum cellular automaton is
                   again a nearest neighbor automaton.
                   We present several construction methods for quantum cellular automata, based
                   on unitaries commuting with their translates, on the quantization of
                   (arbitrary) reversible classical cellular automata, on quantum circuits, and on
                   Clifford transformations with respect to a description of the single cells by
                   finite Weyl systems. Moreover, we indicate how quantum random walks can be
                   considered as special cases of cellular automata, namely by restricting a
                   quantum lattice gas automaton with local particle number conservation to the
                   single particle sector.},

  abstract      = {Discretizing spacetime is often a natural step towards modelling physical
                   systems. For quantum systems, if we also demand a strict bound on the speed of
                   information propagation, we get quantum cellular automata (QCAs). These
                   originally arose as an alternative paradigm for quantum computation, though
                   more recently they have found application in understanding topological phases
                   of matter and have been proposed as models of periodically driven (Floquet)
                   quantum systems, where QCA methods were used to classify their phases. QCAs
                   have also been used as a natural discretization of quantum field theory, and
                   some interesting examples of QCAs have been introduced that become interacting
                   quantum field theories in the continuum limit. This review discusses all of
                   these applications, as well as some other interesting results on the structure
                   of quantum cellular automata, including the tensor-network unitary approach,

                   and others. Some results that show the benefits of basing the model on local
